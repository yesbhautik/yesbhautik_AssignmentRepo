# Solidity Projects

## Overview

This repository contains Solidity smart contracts and tasks related to blockchain development. Each task focuses on specific Solidity functionalities and practical applications.

## 1. SHA-256 Hash with Specific Prefix

Create a Solidity smart contract that finds an input string such that its SHA-256 hash starts with `00000`.

## 2. Input String Starting with Specific Prefix

Modify the Solidity smart contract to ensure the input string starts with `devadnani26`, and find a nonce that results in a SHA-256 hash starting with `00000`.

## 3. Finding a Nonce for Specific Input

Find a nonce for the input string:
Dev => Karan | Rs 100 Karan => Darsh | Rs 10



## 4. CryptoZombies Lesson Completion

Go to [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/en/solidity), create an account, complete Lesson 1: "Making the Zombie Factory," and share a screenshot of the completed lesson.


## 5. Donation Smart Contract

Develop a donation smart contract that allows individuals to donate or transfer money from their personal accounts to various recipients.
